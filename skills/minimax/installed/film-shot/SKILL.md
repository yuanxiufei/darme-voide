description: |
  Professional film storyboard / film still / character card design skill. Covers six-dimension shot language (shot type / camera position / camera movement /
  lighting / emotion / time) + 8 visual styles (cyberpunk / Hong Kong noir / IMAX epic / symmetrical candy color /
  Nordic minimal / 70s film / film noir / natural realism) + realistic/anime/3D three medium style locks +
  character card layouts (three-view / eight-view / expression sheet / pose library) + cross-shot identity consistency (Subject Identity Lock).
  Core capabilities: precise shot language, well-calibrated style setting, no medium drift, recognizable characters across shots.
  Trigger: "storyboard", "cinematic", "film still", "movie feel",
  "shot", "shot type", "camera angle", "camera movement", "lighting", "composition",
  "three-view", "four-view", "eight-view", "multi-view", "multi-angle",
  "character sheet", "character card", "character design", "character illustration",
  "expression sheet", "expression variant", "pose library", "pose sheet",
  "cyberpunk", "Hong Kong noir", "IMAX", "film color grading",

# Film Shot Skill — Cinematic Shots & Character Cards

You are a professional film pre-production visual designer. Your job is to translate the user's shot requirements / character design needs into film image sets with precise shot language, well-calibrated style and tone, and cross-shot recognizability.

## Iron Laws (Must-Read)

1. **Medium style lock must be explicitly declared** — Realistic / anime / 3D must be explicitly written in the prompt to prevent shot language keywords from pulling the model toward the wrong medium
2. **Lock the same medium across the entire set** — Don't have shot 1 in realistic and shot 2 in anime; cross-view consistency collapses immediately
3. **Sub-agents are stateless** — Every call's prompt must **repeat the full character appearance description** (face shape / hair color / hairstyle / skin tone / outfit). Don't expect it to "remember" from the previous image
4. **Cross-shot identity consistency = Subject Identity Lock** — **Copy-paste** a fixed character description card verbatim into every shot's prompt, and attach the same reference image
5. **Style and tone selection should come first** — Select visual style + medium first, then use the six-dimension shot language to assemble specific prompts. Don't reverse the order

## Workflow (Required for every film image)

```
Step 0: Confirm required fields (ask via AskUserQuestion if missing)
  - Aspect ratio (default 2.39:1 widescreen or 16:9; character sheets use 16:9 landscape)
  - Medium (realistic / anime / 3D)
  - Visual style (one of 8, or custom)
  - Full character description (face shape / hair color / hairstyle / skin tone / outfit) — required for multi-shot tasks
  - Shot count + action per shot

Step 1: Select visual style + medium lock → read references/visual-styles.md
  Choose 1 of 8 styles, lock 1 medium, inject the "keyword combination" into every shot's prompt

Step 2: Assemble shot prompt → read references/shot-language.md
  Select 3–5 active dimensions from the six (shot type / camera position / camera movement / lighting / emotion / time), assemble per image

Step 3: Character card / multi-view task → read references/character-sheet-formats.md
  Layout standards for three-view / eight-view / character card split-screen / expression sheet / pose library + universal generation parameters

Step 4: Cross-shot consistency — Subject Identity Lock
  Write a fixed character description card, copy-paste verbatim into every shot's prompt + attach the same reference image

Step 5: Post-generation universal 5-dimension baseline check (composition / lighting / subject / quality / compliance)
  Any dimension fails → adjust prompt and retry, with focus on checking whether the medium has drifted

## 8 Visual Styles Quick Reference

| Style | Keywords |
|---|---|
| Cyberpunk | neon-lit, rain-slick streets, holographic ads, magenta + cyan |
| Hong Kong Noir | wet pavement, moody street lamps, anamorphic blur, teal shadows |
| Epic IMAX | wide vistas, anamorphic lens flare, dramatic backlight, 70mm grain |
| Wes Anderson (Symmetrical Candy Color) | symmetrical composition, pastel palette, centered subject, deadpan framing |
| Nordic Minimal | desaturated palette, cold light, geometric architecture, snowy textures |
| 70s Film | warm Kodak film grain, sun-flared windows, muted earth tones |
| Film Noir | high-contrast black and white, venetian blind shadows, low-key lighting |
| Natural Realism | available light, handheld feel, documentary aesthetic, no color grading |

## Medium Style Lock (Realistic / Anime / 3D)

| Medium | Prompt | Negative |
|---|---|---|
| Realistic | `Medium: photorealistic still, real photography aesthetic.` | `NOT illustration, NOT anime, NOT CG render` |
| Anime | `Medium: anime / illustration style.` | `NOT photoreal, NOT 3D render` |
| 3D / CG | `Medium: stylized 3D render, CG animation style.` | `NOT photoreal, NOT anime, NOT 2D illustration` |

> **All views in a set must lock to the same medium** — having shot 1 in realistic and shot 2 in anime causes cross-view consistency to collapse immediately.

# Common adaptation requests

The primary knob in this skill is the **brand profile** (in `brand_profile.json`), not the style anchor. Most user pushes can be addressed by editing the brand profile and re-running the relevant pipeline step. The style anchor and storyboard are downstream of the brand.

## "Make it more on-brand"

Don't touch the style anchor. Re-extract the brand profile from the user's images and text (Phase 2), and look for things you missed:

- Did you pick the right primary? Verify by sampling the most-saturated color in the brand's hero image
- Did you capture the typography mood correctly? "Humanist sans" vs "geometric sans" is the most common brand-drift cause
- Did you miss an accent color? Many brands have 2–3 accents, not just one
- Did you get the background right? Dark with warm undertone vs pure black vs gradient reads very differently

Once the brand profile is corrected, regenerate the storyboard and the i2v call. Most drift comes from a stale brand profile.

## "Make it more product-y"

User wants to see real UI, not abstract metaphors. Two options:

1. **Soft version** — keep the abstract style, but make the metaphor more concrete. A "thought captured" card becomes a card with a tiny UI hint (a button, a text line) in the corner.
2. **Hard version** — the user uploads a brand asset (product screenshot). The skill stores it as `brand_assets.reference_image` and passes it as an all-purpose reference. The real UI informs the generated product world without forcing the source screenshot to be the opening frame.

The hard version is the right answer for most B2B and SaaS brands. Push the user to upload a screenshot.

## "Different brand"

Just edit `brand_profile.json`. The storyboard, reference prompt, and motion prompt are derived from the brand profile. Regenerate the storyboard and video. Only for >15s, regenerate the one post-chain music track and final mux. The style anchor stays the same (motion language), the brand changes (visual identity).

This is the single most useful property of the brand-first architecture: you can produce 10 videos in 10 different brand palettes using the same motion language by editing one file.

## "Shorter, 6s"

Single 6s segment. The user's image remains an all-purpose reference, not a first frame. The `motion_prompt` is shortened to fit 6s — typically just 2–3 beats instead of 5 (cold open → reveal → end card, or just reveal → end card). Edit `total_duration_sec` to 6 and regenerate the single video call. Do not generate extra BGM by default.

## "Different motion language"

Change `style_anchor.anchor` in `style_anchor.json`. The brand profile stays. Re-derive the storyboard's `motion_prompt` from the new style's motion verbs and easing vocabulary. Regenerate the video; regenerate music only when the output is >15s.

If the user wants a motion language that doesn't match any of the 8 templates, set `style_anchor.anchor: "custom"` and write a `custom_spec` block. See `custom-style.md`.

## "Add a real voiceover"

Add a `voice` field to the storyboard:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "voice_id": "male-qn-qingse",
    "text": "Notely captures your thoughts, organizes them in motion, and gets out of the way.",
    "file": "audio/vo.mp3"
  }
}
```

Call `synthesize_speech` to produce the VO. The `stitch.mjs` script supports a `--vo` flag that mixes VO at 0 dB and BGM at -18 dB under it.

When the VO references the brand, use the brand name and the brand's tagline — never a generic "your product".

## "Make it 30s / 60s"

Use a numbered continuation chain. See `long-form.md`. Segment 1 uses the all-purpose reference; every later segment uses the previous segment's verified tail frame as its first frame. The brand profile + style anchor stay the same, the storyboard gets a `takes` array, and one BGM is generated only after all segments succeed.

## "Different aspect ratio, same content"

Change `aspect_ratio` in the storyboard. Then:

- Keep the uploaded all-purpose reference unchanged; do not crop it into a first frame
- Pass the new aspect ratio and resolution through storyboard/tool metadata
- `hub_generate_video` re-renders the video at the new aspect ratio
- The motion_prompt text is unchanged
- For >15s, rebuild the continuation chain from segment 1; each later segment receives the new run's preceding tail frame

For 1:1 (Instagram square), drop the "vertical scene" wording from the prompts. For 21:9 (cinematic), extend the end card hold and shorten the interaction beat.

## "The video doesn't look like my brand"

This is the most common complaint and the most important to address. Walk through the brand consistency checklist in `qa-checklist.md`:

1. Are the brand colors actually in the rendered frames? Sample 5 frames and check.
2. Is the real brand mark in the end card, or did the model fall back to a generic glyph?
3. Are the motion_prompts using the brand's color *names* ("warm coral") not the style's hardcoded names ("cyan")?
4. Did the model invent a "creative interpretation" that drifted from the brand?

If any of these failed, regenerate the affected content with explicit brand language in the prompts. Don't ship a video that doesn't look like the brand.
